# Notes on the framework for description of optical parametric interaction of pulses propagating in chiral media

This repository contains the formalism of the derivation (`pulsedopo.tex`;
plain TeX code) of the theoretical framework used in the description of optical
parametric interaction of pulses propagating in chiral media.

The presented theory has been published as <em>Pulsed optical parametric
amplification in chiral media</em> by Fredrik Jonsson, Christos Flytzanis
and Govind P. Agrawal, Journal of the Optical Society of America B <b>42</b>,
1335-1341 (2025). DOI:
[https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.563862](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.563862).

## Compiling and running the code

The TeX code for the notes can be compiled using the enclosed `Makefile` simply
by running
```bash
$ make
```
